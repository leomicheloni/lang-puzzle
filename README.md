Lang-puzzle
===========

A little app to extend vocabulary in languages.

Simple, you can start with the existing languages (Spanish and English) the select your main language, lets said Spanish.
Then you can play, a spanish word will be showed in the left panel and 3 possible translations to english in the right panel, so you should chose one.
If it is right, good for you, more points, if not, the correct translations will be showed, then you can continue with the next word.
The wrong word will appear eventually in order you to learn it.

You can add new words (with one correct translation) and new languages too.

Enjoy.
